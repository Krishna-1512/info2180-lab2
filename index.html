            <h1>Krishna Edwards' Blog</h1>
            <p>My name is Krishna Edwards and I am a Computer Science Major at the University of the West Indies.
            I am a goal oriented and driven individual who enjoys watching football, car documentaries,
            engineering documentaries and at times videos that revolve around the latest in technology. I love playing games 
            and hanging out with my friends.

                    Cars are the four-wheeler automobiles that are run for an individual or a small group of people, such as a family. 
                    It is a convenience in the modern world especially in places where the public transport is not easily available or is not very reliable.
                    You can travel from your door to your destination in a state of comfort.
                    With young children and pets, a car is a preferable mode of transport.
                    My main interest is in sports cars as they are being made to defy the laws of science.
                    Sports cars are evolving more and more as the years go by. 
                    Through the dynamic use of aerodynamics, we are able to have some really fast cars out there.

                    Sports cars are known for their light weight, speed, nimble handling, and appearance.
                    They feature special equipment, and with few exceptions manufacturers make only limited numbers of them. 
                    As a result, pound for pound they cost more than most other cars.
                    Famous sports cars include the Chevrolet Corvette of the United States, the Alfa –Romeo and Ferrari of Italy,
                    the Jaguar XK-E, MGB, and Triumph TR-7 of the United Kingdom,
                    the Porsche 911 and Mercedes 300 SL of Germany, and the Mazda Miata and Nissan 370ZX of Japan.
                        Persnoally speaking, jdm cars are some of the greatest cars that have ever been made.
                    They come with higher performing engines and these engines are somewhat more durable compared
                    to the engines that are being used in cars developed in the competing countries acrosss the world.

                    Cars have come a far way, from persons having to steer the car to persons now being chauffered by their vehicles.
                    With the aid of computer science and artificial inteligence, these inventions were able to flourish and become one of the best creations known to man.
                    Elon musk is the owner of Tesla and with the wonderful tool of software engineering and artificial inntelligence,
                    he was able to make one of the fastest computerized cars and he keeps on coming up with ways of how to improve them.
                    All cars manufactured today contain at least one computer. 
                    It is in charge of monitoring engine emissions and adjusting the engine to keep emissions as low as possible. 
                    The computer receives information from a many different sensors, including:

                    1.The oxygen sensor
                    2.The air pressure sensor
                    3.The air temperature sensor
                    4.The engine temperature sensor
                    5.The throttle position sensor
                    6.The knock sensor
                    7.The oxygen sensor
                    Using the information from these sensors, the computer can control things like the fuel injectors, 
                    spark plugs and the idle speed to get the best performance possible from the engine while keeping emissions low. 
                    The computer can also sense when something has gone wrong and can inform the driver with the "Check Engine" light.
                    A mechanic can read a diagnostic code from the computer and fix the problem.

                    My Name is Krishna Edwards and I am a second year student at the University of the West Indies and I am studying
                    computer science. So far this major has been a very rough one but it is super fascinating. Half of the time we really are 
                    struggling to meet deadlines cause the work load is so much, but in the end it will be worth it. I am not sure which area I would 
                    like to specialize in just yet, however, computer science opens your scope to a lot of job opportunities.
